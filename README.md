# TriolabPark

An app built for parking spot management inside a company. Was in internal use on iOS and Android.

## What it did

The app was built around a view with all the company's parking spots and the owners' names. By clicking a parking spot,
an update would be sent to Google's Firebase Firestore â€“backend to update the spot as occupied. That update would then be visible for everyone.
